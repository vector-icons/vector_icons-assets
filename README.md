## The Style Guidelines
For the top-level outline of the icon, a border-radius of 4px should be applied by default to paths with a 90-degree slope. For paths with a slope between 45 to 60 degrees, a maximal border-radius of 1 to 2px should be applied (e.g., 1px for a 45-degree slope).

For the icon's inner line, the border-radius should be set to 2px by default for paths with a 90-degree slope, instead of 4px. For slopes between 45 to 60 degrees, the border-radius can vary between 0px and 2px depending on the case. There are no absolute values or specific calculations for this.
